# 🎯 CLICKABLE CARDS - Direct Streaming Links!

All shows and movies are now **clickable** and link directly to streaming services!

---

## ✅ What I Added

### 1. **Click Any Card** → Opens Streaming Service
- ✅ Click on any movie/show card
- ✅ Opens in new tab automatically
- ✅ Goes directly to that service's search page
- ✅ Shows the exact content you clicked

### 2. **Smart URL Generation**
Each card knows which service it's on and generates the correct URL:

**Netflix:**
```
Stranger Things → https://www.netflix.com/search?q=Stranger+Things
```

**Hulu:**
```
Shrinking → https://www.hulu.com/search?q=Shrinking
```

**Disney+:**
```
The Mandalorian → https://www.disneyplus.com/search?q=The+Mandalorian
```

**Max (HBO):**
```
Succession → https://www.max.com/search?q=Succession
```

**Prime Video:**
```
The Boys → https://www.amazon.com/s?k=The+Boys&i=instant-video
```

### 3. **Service-Specific URLs**
I've mapped each streaming service:
- ✅ Netflix → netflix.com/search
- ✅ Hulu → hulu.com/search
- ✅ Disney+ → disneyplus.com/search
- ✅ Max → max.com/search
- ✅ Apple TV+ → tv.apple.com/search
- ✅ Prime → amazon.com/instant-video

### 4. **Interactive Buttons**
**On Hover:**
- "Watch" button appears
- Click "Watch" → Opens streaming service
- Service badge shows which platform

## 🎯 How It Works

1. Browse movies on your app
2. See "Dune" with [MAX] badge
3. Click anywhere on card
