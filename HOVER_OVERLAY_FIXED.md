# 🎨 Card Hover Overlay Fixed - No More Text Overlap!

## 🎯 **What I Fixed:**

### **1. Removed Centered Overlay** ❌
- ❌ Deleted centered "Discover" text
- ❌ Removed overlapping text elements
- ❌ Eliminated text collision issues

### **2. Added Strategic Positioning** ✅
- ✅ **Top Left** - NEXUS brand + "discover." + "Click to explore"
- ✅ **Bottom Center** - Show title (THE CROWN)
- ✅ **Middle Right** - Watch Trailer button
- ✅ **No overlap** - each element has its own space

---

## 🎨 **New Hover Layout:**

### **Top Left Corner:**
```
NEXUS (red text)
discover. (white)
Click to explore (white, smaller)
```

### **Bottom Center:**
```
THE (small, light)
CROWN (large, bold)
```

### **Middle Right:**
```
[Watch Trailer] (button)
```

5. **Watch Trailer button** - middle right
6. **Service badge** - top right (existing)
