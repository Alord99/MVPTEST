# 🎉 YOUR STREAMHUB IS READY FOR CLASS!

## ✅ What I Built For You

I've created **StreamHub** - a unified platform that combines:

1. **🎬 Streaming Discovery** (like JustWatch)
   - Browse trending movies & TV shows
   - Real data from TMDB API
   - Beautiful content cards with ratings
   - Service badges showing where content streams
   - "Discover More Services" section

2. **💰 Subscription Tracker** (integrated from MVPtest)
   - Track all streaming subscriptions
   - See monthly/yearly spending
   - Direct links to Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, etc.
   - Add unlimited subscriptions
   - Visual spending analytics

**Both features work together seamlessly!**
